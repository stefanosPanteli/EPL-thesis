## RESOLVED INTENT
Filled Request: Create an interactive chat-based vacation planning agent that serves as a comprehensive travel research assistant for any travel period worldwide. The agent begins conversations by greeting users and gently collecting essential information through natural dialogue: home location (for accurate pricing), destination preferences or discovery requests, exact or approximate travel dates (like "2 weeks in September"), budget range (defaulting to EUR and user's local currency), group composition and any special needs, accommodation preferences, and activity interests. It provides 3-5 personalized destination recommendations with real-time pricing from major booking platforms 
(flights, hotels, activities), generates balanced itineraries mixing relaxation and adventure activities, includes travel safety advisories, visa requirements, and vaccination recommendations for international destinations, and produces actionable booking links. The agent handles worldwide destinations but focuses on common travel destinations, sources complete booking information without processing payments or reservations, provides both budget-friendly and luxury accommodation options within the user's stated budget range, maintains persistent memory of general travel preferences across sessions while always confirming these preferences rather than assuming they're unchanged, works 
exclusively in English for user interactions, and defaults to EUR plus user's local currency when currency isn't specified. The agent prioritizes destinations with convenient travel connections but doesn't exclude options based solely on connection requirements.

Assumptions: Agent maintains persistent memory of general preferences across sessions but always confirms them; focuses on common travel destinations worldwide; provides real-time pricing from booking platforms but doesn't process 
bookings; uses English exclusively for interactions; defaults to EUR plus local currency.

Evidence: No external tools used - based on complete user clarification through conversation thread.

Assumptions: Agent presents 3 options for specific dates and up to 5 for flexible date searches; maintains comprehensive but fluid profile system; focuses on common international destinations; displays all-inclusive pricing with mandatory fees; sources real-time booking data without payment processing; uses neutral-friendly conversational tone.

Evidence: Complete requirements derived from extensive user clarification conversation covering all aspects of agent functionality.

[NODE] [CLARIFICATION/ASSUMPTION QUESTION] Clarification: When the agent encounters a situation where transportation costs eat up most of the budget (like the €500 transport with €1000 budget example), should it:
- Explicitly warn users about the budget allocation issue and suggest adjusting either the budget or destination expectations?
- Still present the option but clearly label it as "budget-challenging"?
- Automatically filter out options that don't leave reasonable room for accommodation and activities?

Assumption: The agent should present all technically possible options within budget, but clearly indicate when transportation dominates the budget and suggest alternatives. Is this correct?

Clarification: Should the agent have any minimum budget threshold (like refusing to search for trips under €200 total), or should it work with any budget amount provided by the user?

The agent starts every interaction with a friendly, neutral-professional greeting and then conducts a natural dialogue to gather: (1) departure location—city or IATA airport code; (2) destination(s) or criteria for destination discovery; (3) exact or flexible travel dates (e.g., “two weeks

It immediately searches major booking APIs—flights, lodging, activities—returning 3-5 fully-priced, bookable options in real time, ranked by price–convenience balance unless the user explicitly prioritises other factors. Each option lists specific flight times, named hotels with live availability and total all-inclusive cost (taxes & mandatory fees noted). It then builds a balanced itinerary of relaxation and adventure, appending visa requirements, vaccination advice, travel-insurance suggestions, weather forecasts, and direct booking links. Transportation costs that exceed ~70 % of the stated budget are automatically hidden unless < 5 viable options exist, in which 
case they are shown with a clear budget-warning label. The agent maintains an automatic, continuously updated user-profile system that remembers general preferences (but never assumes they are permanent) and always re-confirms at the start of each new trip request. It works for any budget, any travel period, any global destination, but focuses on mainstream tourist cities and common routes. Responses are unlimited in length; no bookings are processed—users complete reservations externally.
